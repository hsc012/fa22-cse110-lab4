1. "values added: 20"
2. "final result: 20"
3. "values added: 20"
4. Error, because since `result` is declared as `let` type inside the if statement, it cannot be accessed outside the if block.
5. Error, because line 7 will result in an error, since `result` is type `const` its value cannot be changed, so even without the error, line 9 will print out "values added: 0" instead of "values added: 20".
6. Error, because as explained in question #5, line 7 will result in an error, so the program will not reach line 13. However, even without the previous error, line 13 itself will result in an error, because since `result` is declared as `const` type inside the if statement, it cannot be accessed outside the if block.
